# Sidebar Project

The purpose of the project is to provide a sidebar using plain JavaScript without using frameworks.  However, Font Awesome and Google Fonts (e.g. to use Font Roboto) will be used.

## UX

### User Stories

As a user, I expect to show or hide the sidebar.

As a user, when the sidebar is shown and the times icon is clicked, the sidebar is hidden.

As a user, when I hover on to the links, the color changes.
