# Sidebar Project

The purpose of the project is to provide a sidebar using plain JavaScript without using frameworks.  However, Font Awesome and Google Fonts (e.g. to use Font Roboto) will be used.

## UX

### User Stories

As a user, I expect to show or hide the sidebar.

As a user, when the sidebar is shown and the times icon is clicked, the sidebar is hidden.

As a user, when I hover on to the links, the color changes.

As a user, when I hover on to the icons (except bars and times), I expect a tooltip (e.g. LinkedIn) to be displayed.

As a user, when I click on a link, I expect to go to the correct page.

As a user, when I click on an external link, I expect the link to open in a new window without leaving the Sidebar Project page.

### Information Architecture

The project consists of:

    - index.html (Home Page)
    - about.html
    - projects.html
    - contact.html

Organising principle is interests or biography.

In the projects page, there are links to live projects and GitHub repositories in each project.  These projects are with Code Institute and FreeCodeCamp.

In the contact page, there are links to professional associations (e.g. British Computer Society) and professional social media (e.g. LinkedIn).
